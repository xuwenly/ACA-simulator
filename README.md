## Project structure:
- aca
  - source code of simulator
  - aca-config
  - rules 
- run
  - binaray files of simulator
- Demo videos

## Preparatory Work:
The aca simulator is implemented in Java，JDK version 1.8.

## Simulation reversible triangle partitioned cellular automata（RPCA） on an alpha asynchronous cellular automata simulator

you can run simulator with:
 - (1) aca.bat(windows) under run directory
 - (2) run Aca.java class in source code

also you should set parameters to simulator in command line, such as:

"-m vnca -s 5 -g 5".

"-m" is simulate mode, "-s" is cell state, "-g" pixel of cell in screen.

you can set  simulate mode in vnca, blockvnca, pca and so on.    

after simulator frame started.

- (1)choose the rule and configurations.
- (2)set update rate 
- (3) click run or stop button

then the simulate begin or stop.

## Demo
The Demo videos of merge, Fork, Tria and 2bit-Encoder could be found in "Demo.pptx".
